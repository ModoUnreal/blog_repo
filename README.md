# blog_repo
A repository which holds all of my blog contents

## What is this?
So this is a place for me to store all of my blog posts, just in case I lose all of my local files and also because I don't trust my blogging platform.
This is **not** a place where I keep the code for the website, however I will maybe implement this over the coming years. As of right now I haven't used any html/css for my website.

## Blog link
